## Attribution

This project is a fork of [betterfountain](https://github.com/piersdeseilligny/betterfountain) by Piers Deseilligny, stripped of a lot of functionality and decoupled from VScode to allow for configurable PDF and HTML exports of a .fountain file in CLI environments.
##
This is an fork of an extension for Visual Studio Code which allows you to write screenplays using the [fountain](https://fountain.io/) syntax quickly and efficiently. [(If you're already confused click here)](https://github.com/piersdeseilligny/betterfountain/blob/master/FAQ.md).

Unlike other screenwriting software (such as Final Draft) BetterFountain focuses on removing friction between you and the text - there's no page breaks, no large unintuitive menus and overlapping windows, no delays when you press "Enter" after having written some dialogue, no slow loading documents, none of that. Just text and a handfull of unintruding features which remove even more friction between the story in your head and a finished screenplay.

And because it's an a CLI tool, you can use it in Github Actions to automate a publishing workflow.
## Features (courtesy of Piers)
* Industry-standard PDF generation
    * Includes scenes and sections as PDF bookmarks, for easy navigation in your reader of choice
    * Possible to highlight any specified characters in the PDF
* Custom font support (Add "Font:" at the top of your .fountain screenplay, with the other title page keys, followed by the name of a font installed on your system) (untested)
* Approximation of a screenplay's duration (with -i flag, untested)
## Why?

Writing with fountain lets you focus on the essential. With the addition of autocomplete and syntax highlighting, you have the ultimate clutter-free ultra-fast solution for writing screenplays. And because it's an extension for vscode, it's free and cross-platform, and you get lots of other cool features such as integrated source control and near-infinite extensibility.

## Usage
```sh
npm install -g fountainpub

# Convert to PDF
fountainpub script.fountain -p
fountainpub script.fountain -p script.pdf

# Convert to HTML
fountainpub script.fountain -h
fountainpub script.fountain -h script.html

# Convert to both
fountainpub script.fountain -p -h
fountainpub script.fountain -p script.pdf -h script.html

# With custom configuration
fountainpub script.fountain -p script.pdf --config .fountainpubrc
```

```
fountainpub <source.fountain> -[p|h|i]

-p, -p <o.pdf>  generates a pdf in the 
                same directory with the 
                same base name, unless 
                another name is provided

-h, -h <o.html> generates a html in the 
                same directory with the 
                same base name, unless 
                another name is provided

-i:             prints screenplay 
                statistics
```
## Configuration
```yaml
print_profile: 'usletter'  # or 'a4'
scenes_numbers: 'left'     # 'left', 'right', 'both', or false
embolden_character_names: true
show_page_numbers: true
text_contd: "(CONT'D)"
text_more: "(MORE)"
```

## To Do

I mean this is my first npm package and it was crudely ripped out of vscode, so I'm sure it can be cleaned up. PRs welcome.
